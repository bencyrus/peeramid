        <h3>Peeramid is a collaboration platform</h3>
        <p>We aim to ease up the processing of entering a market as easy as possible for applicants,
            and hiring talent as easy as possible for recruiters and companies</p>
        <p>Peeramid allows users to create projects and seek partners to work on them, find projects that already exist and
            collaborate on them.</p>
        <p>Users showcase their hard and soft skills and level of knowledge through projects they work on and publish, as well
            as building networks based on real professional collaborations</p>
        <p>recruiters also can browse open to work users and judge them based on the projects they have worked on and hands on
            abilities they have rather than relying on a certificate or proof of qualification</p>
        <p>after all, "Good wine needs no bush!"</p>
