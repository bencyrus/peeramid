            <h1>Peeramid is a collaboration platform</h1>
            <p>We aim to ease up the process of entering a profession as easy as possible for applicants,
                and hiring talent as easy as possible for recruiters and companies</p>
            <p>Peeramid allows users to create projects and seek partners to work on them, find projects that already exist and
                collaborate on them.</p>
            <p>Users showcase their hard and soft skills and level of expertise through projects they work on and publish, as well
                as building networks based on real professional collaborations</p>
            <p>recruiters also can browse open-to-work users and judge them based on the projects they have worked on and hands on
                abilities they have rather than relying on a certificate or proof of qualification</p>
            <p>after all, "Good wine needs no bush!"</p>
